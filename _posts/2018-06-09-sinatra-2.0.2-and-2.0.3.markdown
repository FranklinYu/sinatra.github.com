We would like to inform you that we have released Sinatra v2.0.2 and v2.0.3.

Before we begin, I want to thank everyone who contributed, helped test pre-releases, and continues to use and support the project.

## Security Fix CVE-2018-11627

Sinatra had a critical vulnerability since v2.0.0.
The purpose of this release is to fix [CVE-2018-11627](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-11627).

The vulnerability is that XSS can be executed by using illegal parameters.
[The issue](https://github.com/sinatra/sinatra/issues/1428) was reported by [@JokerCatz](https://github.com/JokerCatz).
Thank you so much.

If you're using Sinatra v2.0.x, please upgrade to v2.0.2 or later.'
